##Acknowledgements
First of all, I'd like to thank Thomas Jollans for his great VinylScrobbler project (https://github.com/tjol/vinylscrobbler) which was my primary source of inspiration.

Second, thanks to Patrik Ã…kerfeldt for his signpost-retrofit adapter (https://github.com/pakerfeldt/signpost-retrofit), saving me quite the amount of headaches.

Finally, thanks to all the library developers, making their libraries available for a much more pleasant Android coding experience!
